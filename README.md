# Payeezy JS Payment Module for Zen Cart

## About

The Payeezy JS payment service is a PCI Compliant payment solution which *does* show credit card fields on your store, to accept credit card payments, but does *all* the processing offsite (via background javascript/ajax processing), so that none of the card data ever touches your store/server. 
There is no redirecting of customers offsite, so customers enjoy a more seamless checkout experience.

The payment gateway is powered by First Data, and is availalble to all First Data and Global Gateway E4 merchants.

## Compatibility

This module is compatible with Zen CartÂ® v1.5.4 and v1.5.5

This module requires minimum PHP 5.6.0

## Installation
